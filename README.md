## Assumptions

  * a predix.io account has been obtained by the reader
  * all relevant credentials to specific workspaces have been given to the reader's predix.io account
  * the reader has some familiarity with Javascript and/or NodeJS, as well as web-based technologies such as Express web server, REST, and HTML
  * the reader is familiar with object-oriented software development techniques
  * there will be instances where GE networking (proxies) will 'get in the way' of proper operation; this guide assumes the reader is able to work around/with their proxy settings in order to accomodate communications to/from external resources (git, npm, bower, predix.io) and where applicable, internal git repositories as well
